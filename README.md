# StormFinder
This code could help to find the storms among the rainfall data. In particular, it is desinged to find the SCS type II cumulative curve. 
### Description of the code: 
The potential challenge would appear when you want to find the storms among a large dataset (e.g. 60 years of data with an interval of 15 mins), this code (stormfinder.m) needs a CSV file of your data including only one column (i.e. Rainfall data). You only need to adjust the date in stormfinder.m and then run it. A tutorial video is available here to show how this code works. It should point out that this code is set to find the 6 hours storms that normally are more intense consequalntly, they could generate the storms closer to the type II of SCS curves.
